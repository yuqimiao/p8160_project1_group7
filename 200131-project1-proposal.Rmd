# 1 Objectives 
Design a simulation study to investigate and illustrate 
how well each of the two methods in identifying weak and strong predictors;
how missing “weak” predictors impacts the parameter estimations. 
To do so, you need to simulate data with a combination of strong'',weak-but-correlated” and “weak-and- independent” predictors. 

# 2 Statistical methods to be studied 

## 2.1 Step-wise forward method

Starting with the empty model, and iteratively adds the variables that best improves the model fit. That is often done by sequentially adding predictors with the largest reduction in AIC. For linear models,
$$AIC=n\ln(\sum_{i=1}^n{(y_i-\widehat{y_i})}^2/n)+2p$$
where $\widehat{y_i}$ is the fitted values from a model, and $p$ is the dimension of the model (i.e.,number of predictors plus 1).

## 2.2 Automated LASSO regression LASSO

another popular method for variable selection. It estimates the model parameters by optimizing a penalized loss function:

$$\underset\beta{min}\frac{1}{2n}\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-x_i\beta)^2+\lambda\sum_{k=1}^p|\beta_k|$$
where $\lambda$ is a tunning parameter. Cross-validation (CV) is the most common selection criteria for LASSO.


# 3 Scenarios to be investigated 

* weak-to-strong predictor ratio;


# 4 Methods for generating data 


# 5 performance measures 
## 5.1 Predictor identification performance

In order to compare the performance on identify weak and strong parameters, an F1 score was constructed:

$$F=\left(\frac{2}{recall^{-1}+precision^{-1}}\right)$$
Where recall is defined as the ratio of truely identified strong predictors to all true strong ones, precision is defined as the ratio of true strong predictors to all selected ones. F score is defined as the harmonic mean of these two ratio, which illustrates the strong predictors identification ability of two methods

**How to compare the identification ability of weak but correlated predictors and weak and independent predictors? **


## 5.2 estimation performance

To compare the paramater estimation performance, linear models were fitted respectively using the selected predictors generated by two methods. Then draw plots of estimations and calculate the bias and se of estimated variables.
